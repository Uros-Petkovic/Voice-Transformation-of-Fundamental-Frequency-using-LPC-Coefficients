# Voice-Transformation-of-Fundamental-Frequency-using-LPC-Coefficients
This project implemented Voice Transformation of Fundamental Frequency and LPC Coefficients using Neural Networks

Project is about voice and his transformation from male to female and female to male. For training and testing was used Dataset from Kaggle with BDL and SLT signals, actually recorded voice sentences.

Implemented LPC synthesis and analysis of the coefficients for knowing the voice structure and mapped fundamental frequency with Praat software.

For training and testing is used deep neural network implemented in Matlab.

For whole project look for the commited files.

For results look for the directory Results.

For my paper of Bachelor thesis look [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/Voice-Transformation-of-Fundamental-Frequency-using-LPC-Coefficients/blob/main/Bachelor%20Thesis%20Voice%20Transformation.pdf).
